## About me


## About this site
I want to see a more decentralised, ownership-focused future for the Internet. This site is my small way of manifesting that future, by learning to own my corner of the Internet, rather than renting it from one of a small handful of oligarchs.

What I will do with this little parcel of the New World is still a work in progress! For now, I treat it as an empty auditorium. The exercise of publishing thoughts and creations here, presented to an imaginary audience, focuses me on following through with those creations. I would be delighted if someone who wanders in finds something to interest them, but it will be a happy accident.
