## About me
I live in South London in the UK, working as a Product Manager for a sustainability-driven software company. I'm a perpetual amateur, easily grabbed by a new hobby or interest, but some reliably reoccuring passions are maths,  software and technology, sustainability, politics and economics (generally of the left-wing variety), film, and chess.

## About this site
I want to see a more decentralised, user-owned future for the Internet. This site is my small way of manifesting that future, by learning to own my corner of the Internet, rather than renting it from one of a small handful of oligarchs.

What I will do with this little parcel of the New World is still a work in progress! For now, I treat it as an empty auditorium. The exercise of publishing thoughts and creations here, presented to an imaginary audience, gives me a focus and orientation for that work. I would be delighted if someone who wanders in finds something to interest them, but I will treat it as a happy accident.
