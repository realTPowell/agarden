Interesting analysis of the apparently non-productive economy of Big Tech, by situating it as accelerating the _circulation_ of capital in Marx's model, rather than contributing (predominantly at least) to capital's productive forces. Ended weakly for me; I would struggle to summarise its proposed vision of "biocommunism". Unfortunately this mostly read like a typical "what if things were good instead of bad" proposal to end the last chapter of a progressive book.

Prompted an interest for me in _central planning_, in the light of 70s cybernetics (Stafford Beer and his work with Allende in Chile) and present-day computational power.
